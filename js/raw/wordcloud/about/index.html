<h1>How the Word Cloud Generator Works</h1>

<p>The layout is available on GitHub as <a href="http://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a>.  It requires <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/">D3</a>.

<p>As word placement can be quite slow for more than a few hundred words, the layout algorithm can be run <em>asynchronously</em>, with a configurable time step size.  This makes it possible to animate words as they are placed without stuttering.  It is recommended to always use a time step even without animations as it prevents the browser’s event loop from blocking while placing the words.

<p>This is how the layout above is configured:

<pre><code id="code-layout">var fontSize = d3.scale.log().range([10, 100]);

var layout = cloud()
    .size([960, 600])
    .timeInterval(10)
    .text(function(d) { return d.key; })
    .font("Impact")
    .fontSize(function(d) { return fontSize(+d.value); })
    .rotate(function(d) { return ~~(Math.random() * 5) * 30 - 60; })
    .padding(1)
    .on("word", progress)
    .on("end", draw)
    .words([&hellip;])
    .start();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>text</code>, <code>font</code>, <code>fontSize</code>,
  <code>rotate</code> and <code>padding</code> options all take either constant
  values or accessor functions that are called for each datum.

<p>There are two events:

<ul>
  <li><code>"word"</code>, fired each time a word is successfully placed,
  <li><code>"end"</code>, fired when all words have been placed.
</ul>

<p>To stop a running layout, simply call <code>layout.stop()</code>.  For
  synchronous operation, you can use <code>timeInterval(Infinity)</code>.

<h2>Web Fonts</h2>

<p>Yes, it’s possible to use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/">@font-face</a>
  fonts, too, although you need to wait until the font is loaded before
  starting the layout.

<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>

<p>The layout algorithm itself is incredibly simple.  For each word, starting
  with the most “important”:

<ol>
  <li>Attempt to place the word at some starting point: usually near the
    middle, or somewhere on a central horizontal line.
  <li>If the word intersects with any previously-placed words, move it one step
    along an increasing spiral.  Repeat until no intersections are found.
</ol>

<p>The hard part is making it perform efficiently!  According to Jonathan
Feinberg, <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a> uses a combination of
hierarchical bounding boxes and quadtrees to achieve reasonable speeds.

<h2>Glyphs in JavaScript</h2>

<p>There isn’t a way to retrieve precise glyph shapes via the DOM, except
perhaps for SVG fonts.  Instead, we draw each word to a hidden canvas element,
and retrieve the pixel data.

<p>Retrieving the pixel data separately for each word is expensive, so we draw
as many words as possible and then retrieve their pixels in a batch operation.

<h2>Sprites and Masks</h2>

<p>My initial implementation performed collision detection using sprite masks.
Once a word is placed, it doesn't move, so we can copy it to the appropriate
position in a larger sprite representing the whole placement area.

<p>The advantage of this is that collision detection only involves comparing a
candidate sprite with the relevant area of this larger sprite, rather than
comparing with each previous word separately.

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, a simple low-level hack made a tremendous difference:
when constructing the sprite I compressed blocks of 32 1-bit pixels into 32-bit
integers, thus reducing the number of checks (and memory) by 32 times.

<p>In fact, this turned out to beat my hierarchical bounding box with quadtree
implementation on everything I tried it on (even very large areas and font
sizes).  I think this is primarily because the sprite version only needs to
perform a single collision test per candidate area, whereas the bounding box
version has to compare with every other previously-placed word that overlaps
slightly with the candidate area.

<p>Another possibility would be to merge a word’s tree with a single large tree
once it is placed.  I think this operation would be fairly expensive though
compared with the analagous sprite mask operation, which is essentially ORing a
whole block.

<h2>Hierarchical Bounding Boxes</h2>

<p>I didn’t want the hierarchical bounding box code to go to waste.  Click to
  see more glyphs, or drag to test for collisions!

<div id="bbtree"></div>

<h2>Future Work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I think a bit more performance can be squeezed out of the sprite
    collision detections e.g. by using a hierarchy of coarse sprite masks, but
    the 32-bit compression trick is a bit fiddly to implement.
  <li>It should be possible to use HTML and CSS3 instead of SVG, but the
    positions currently refer to the bottom-centre of each word so this makes it
    slightly trickier in CSS3.
</ul>

<h2>Beware!</h2>

<p>Use word clouds with care; while they’re æsthetically pleasing, there are
  almost always better ways to visualise and analyse data.  For an in-depth
  rant about how they can be bad, see:
