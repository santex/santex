      Anteaters, also known as antbear, are the four mammal species of the suborder Vermilingua (meaning "worm tongue") commonly known for eating ants and termites. Together with the sloths, they compose the order Pilosa. The name "anteater" is also colloquially applied to the unrelated aardvark, numbat, echidna, and pangolin.
